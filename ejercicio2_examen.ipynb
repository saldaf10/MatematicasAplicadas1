No considera la intensidad ni los detalles de la trama, solo la clasificación general.\n","\n","- **Levenshtein (sinopsis):** Mide la similitud **textual** entre las descripciones. Captura coincidencias en la narrativa, vocabulario y estructura de las oraciones. Sin embargo, es sensible a la redacción: dos películas con tramas similares pero descritas con palabras diferentes tendrán alta distancia.\n","\n","- **Euclidiana (atributos numéricos):** Mide la similitud en términos de **escala de producción y éxito comercial** (presupuesto, ingresos, popularidad). Películas con presupuestos y recaudaciones similares serán cercanas, independientemente de su temática o trama.\n","\n","**Los resultados difieren** porque cada métrica opera sobre un espacio de características completamente distinto. Una película puede tener los mismos géneros que \"The Matrix Revolutions\" (baja distancia Jaccard) pero un presupuesto muy diferente (alta distancia Euclidiana), o viceversa.\n","\n","### ¿Qué distancia usaría para recomendar películas? ¿Por qué?\n","\n","Para un **sistema de recomendación**, lo ideal sería una **combinación ponderada** de las tres métricas, ya que cada una captura información complementaria. Sin embargo, si se debe elegir una sola:\n","\n","- La **distancia de Jaccard por géneros** es la más práctica y robusta para recomendaciones generales, porque los géneros son el criterio más intuitivo que los usuarios emplean al buscar películas similares (\"quiero ver otra película de acción y ciencia ficción\"). Es computacionalmente eficiente, no depende de la redacción del overview, y captura la esencia temática de la película.\n","\n","- Una mejora adicional sería combinar Jaccard con la distancia Euclidiana sobre atributos numéricos para refinar las recomendaciones según el \"perfil\" de producción de la película, asegurando que se recomienden películas de una escala similar.\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.0"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
